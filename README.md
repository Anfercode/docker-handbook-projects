# Docker Handbook Projects

![...](./docker-handbook-github.png)

| :bell: NOTIFICATION |
|:--------------------|
| This branch contains the projects for 2nd edition of the handbook. If you want the ones from the 1st edition, please check the [master](https://github.com/fhsinchy/docker-handbook-projects/tree/master/) or [containerized](https://github.com/fhsinchy/docker-handbook-projects/tree/containerized/) branch. |

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the Linux Terminal.
- Familiarity with JavaScript (some of the later projects use JavaScript).

It's fine if you haven't worked with JavaScript that much. Having a basic knowledge of executing scripts with `npm` will suffice.
